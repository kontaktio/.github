# Kontakt.io Engineering Defaults

## 👋 Welcome
This repository serves as the central hub for Kontakt.io's organization-wide engineering configurations. It houses the default community health files—such as Pull Request templates and Issue templates—that automatically apply to all repositories within our organization unless specifically overridden.

## 🏥 About Kontakt

https://kontakt.io

At Kontakt.io, we analyze millions of data points to optimize care delivery, reduce length of stay, keep staff and patients safe, and eliminate operational waste with an AI platform delivered as a managed service.

## 📂 Repository Contents

This repository defines the following defaults for all Kontakt.io engineering projects:

| File / Directory | Description |
+--------------------------+-------------+
| `pull_request_template.md` | The standard template for all Pull Requests. It ensures every PR includes context, testing verification, and Jira ticket links. |


## 🚀 Usage

### Overriding Defaults
If a specific project requires a unique PR template or contribution guide, create a `.github/` folder in that repository and add a `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` file there. Local files always take precedence over these organization-wide defaults.
